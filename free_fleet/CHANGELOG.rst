  Refactor
* seems to be fully refactored, not tested yet
* basic interfaces and structure of free_fleet_server_ros2 done
* server impl done but not tested
* addition of minimal dds tests in free fleet core package
* build and basic publish test done
* all because of linker language missed out of a C and CXX
* undefined references for some of the objects, not sure why yet
* Perhaps a find_package() call is missing for an IMPORTED target, or an ALIAS target is missing?
* still trying to figure out why the link is needed
* starting internal impl
* looks like impl ptrs are needed
* ros1 client package somehow also needs to link with cyclonedds?
* testing vendor build
* trying to link ddsc
* finished some basic documentation
* forward declaration of dds message types, leave timing and publishing state to the client
* message utils should be done
* helper message structs
* before refactoring everything into rosless projects
